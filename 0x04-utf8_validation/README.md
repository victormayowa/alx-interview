Tasks
0. UTF-8 Validation
mandatory
Write a method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

Prototype: def validUTF8(data)
Return: True if data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else return False
A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long
The data set can contain multiple characters
The data will be represented by a list of integers
Each integer represents 1 byte of data, therefore you only need to handle the 8 least significant bits of each integer

To properly cite a webpage using the APA (American Psychological Association) style, you can follow the following format:


Author(s). (Date). Title of the page. Site Name. Retrieved from URL


For example, suppose you want to cite a webpage about climate change from the Environmental Protection Agency website, with no specific author or publication date listed. The citation would look like this:


Environmental Protection Agency. (n.d.). Climate Change. Retrieved from https://www.epa.gov/climate-change


Please note that in this example, since there is no specific author mentioned, the organization or website name is used in the author's place. Additionally, if there is a specific publication date available, it should be included in the format (Author(s), Date).
